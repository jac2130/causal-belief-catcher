Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker,
 Leader HOYER, fellow Members, and a
 special welcome to our new Members
 and their families and friends who are
 here today.
 We begin this new Congress at a
 great time of challenge for the Amer-
 ican people. This winter, working fami-
 lies are struggling to pay their bills
 and keep their homes; small businesses
 are being forced to choose between cut-
 ting jobs and closing their doors;
 health costs are rising; college savings
 funds and 401(k)s have declined in value
 substantially; parents are deeply wor-
 ried about their children's future.
 I think it's a time of anxiety for mil-
 lions of Americans, some of whom face
 economic challenges not seen in this
 country for generations. When things
 are at their worst for the American
 people, we owe them our best. This
 Congress must rise to the occasion.
 Two weeks from today, we will inau-
 gurate a new President. President-elect
 Obama has expressed a desire to govern
 from the center and put the needs of
 our country first. I think all of you
 know Washington is a difficult town,
 and it won't always be easy for him to
 do these things. But when our new
 President extends his hand across the
 aisle to do what is right for our coun-
 try, Republicans will extend ours in re-
 turn.
 During the 111th Congress, Repub-
 licans will strive not to be the party of
 opposition, but the party of better so-
 lutions.
 President-elect Obama's calls for in-
 clusiveness are already being put to
 the test. He's called on Congress to
 move quickly and in a bipartisan fash-
 ion on legislation to help our economy.
 And at this time of economic anxiety,
 the American people deserve open de-
 bate and transparency in their Con-
 gress-a key ingredient needed to
 produce good legislation. And my hope
 is we will adopt a Rules package for
 the new Congress that encourages
 transparency and debate and helps en-
 sure our institution is accountable to
 the people it serves.
 Our Nation has faced adversity be-
 fore, and we have never failed to meet
 the challenge. This is because America
 is a land of limitless potential, and
 when we harness the will of the Amer-
 ican people, commit ourselves to mak-
 ing the most of the blessings God has
 bestowed on this great country, and
 bring all of these gifts to bear on a
 common goal, there is no obstacle that
 we cannot overcome.
 America's potential is unlimited, but
 government's potential is not. And we
 must not confuse the two.
 We can't simply spend our way back
 to prosperity. Our responsibilities as
 elected leaders in a flagging economy
 is to craft policies that allow our coun-
 try's potential to be unleashed. Amer-
 ica runs on freedom. It's the fuel of our
 economy, and it is the fuel of our de-
 mocracy. The more we spend and the
 more we tax, the less freedom we will
 have left.
 So we need to take responsible action
 together to help put our economy back
 on a path toward prosperity. The
 months ahead can be a time of hope
 and renewal in America. The American
 people are giving their best. Here in
 Congress, we need to do the same.
 Madam Speaker, as we start the new
 Congress, we stand ready to work with
 you and your fellow Democrats for gen-
 uine solutions, for real reforms that
 put the needs of our country first and
 bring the blessings of liberty fully to
 bear on the challenges the American
 people face.
 In that spirit, it is my privilege to
 present to you the gavel of the 111th
 Congress.
 Ms. PELOSI. Thank you very much,
 Leader BOEHNER.
 Together, we welcome the many new
 Members of Congress who today join
 the House of Representatives of the
 United States of America. Congratula-
 tions to all of our new Members and to
 our re-elected Members.
 Your constituents have placed great
 trust in you. Your families have given
 you the love and support to make your
 leadership possible. Let us join to-
 gether now and salute the families of
 the 111th Congress.
 I also want to thank my own family:
 my husband of 45 years, Paul Pelosi;
 and our children, Nancy Corinne,
Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alex-
 andra; and our grandchildren, Alex-
 ander and Madeleine, Liam, Sean,
 Ryan, Paulie, and Thomas.
 And I also want to acknowledge my
 brother, Thomas D'Alesandro, the
 former mayor of Baltimore.
 I wish to express my appreciation of
 the people of San Francisco for grant-
 ing me the privilege of representing
 them and serving them in Congress.
 And I thank my caucus. Thank you,
 Mr. HOYER, Mr. CLYBURN; thank you,
 Mr. LARSON, for your nomination this
 morning. Thank you to the Members of
 the caucus for granting me the historic
 opportunity of breaking the marble
 ceiling and to serve, once again, as the
 first woman Speaker of the House.
 Leader BOEHNER, thank you for your
 generous words and for your commit-
 ment to put country ahead of party.
 Without reservation, let us stand to-
 gether, not just today, but in the days
 ahead to live up to that resolve.
 Few Congresses and few Presidents in
 history have been given the responsi-
 bility and the privilege of serving the
 Nation in a time of such profound chal-
 lenge. We do so renewed and refreshed
 by the new Members who join our
 ranks today. Again, welcome to our
 new Members.
 It is in that spirit that I pledge to
 you-let us all pledge to the American
 people that we will look forward, not
 backward; we will join hands, not point
 fingers; we will rise to the challenge,
 recognizing that our love of country is
 stronger than any issue which may di-
 vide us.
 This is the lesson and the legacy of
 the last election: The American people
 demanded a new era of change and ac-
 countability. Yes, we have problems as
 grave as our country has faced in gen-
 erations. But now we enter a new Con-
 gress with a new era with a powerful
 sense of hope and pride in our great
 country.
 Two weeks from today, as Mr.
 BOEHNER indicated, on the steps of this
 Capitol, we will inaugurate the 44th
 President of the United States. From
 the inaugural platform, he will walk
 down the long stretch of the National
 Mall and see the steps of the Lincoln
 Memorial from which Rev. Martin Lu-
 ther King, Jr., called us to the deepest
 truth of our founding dream.
 When Barack Obama raises his right
 hand and takes the oath of office, we
 will know-and the world will wit-
 ness-how far America has come. We
 will celebrate that moment, but recog-
 nize it as only a beginning.
 Together, with our new President,
 we, as a Congress and a country, must
 fulfill the rest of America's promise.
 All of that promise will not be re-
 deemed quickly or easily, but it must
 be pursued urgently with spirited de-
 bate and without partisan deadlock or
 delay.
 Hardworking and still hopeful Ameri-
 cans who are losing their jobs, their

 businesses, their retirement savings,
 their homes that are facing fore-
 closure, cannot wait any longer for us
 to move from the depths of a recession
 to the solid ground of an honest and
 fair prosperity for the many, not just
 the few.
 We need action, and we need action
 now.
 Families and children without health
 care, and millions more who fear losing
 coverage or who are facing rising costs,
 cannot afford to wait any longer.
 We need action, and we need action
 now.
 States facing financial crises, which
 are threatening the education and the
 health of our children, the well-being
 of our seniors, and the public safety of
 our communities, cannot afford to wait
 any longer.
 We need action, and we need action
 now.
 Our country is challenged by the cli-
 mate crisis, by the need for energy se-
 curity, and the need for 21st-century
 infrastructure. On all of these issues
 and many more, we cannot afford to
 wait.
 Our Nation needs action, and we need
 action now.
 America's crises at home are
 matched by conflicts abroad-a ter-
 rorist threat that could strike there or
 here. We cannot afford to wait to renew
 our alliances, our leadership, and our
 respect in the world. We cannot afford
 to wait to deploy the power of our
 ideals. For the sake of our security, for
 the courageous Americans who serve
 on the front lines, and for our veterans
 who have bravely served our country,
 we cannot afford to wait to modernize
 and rebuild our military.
 Every chance we get we must express
 our appreciation to our heroic men and
 women in uniform and their families
 for their service and their sacrifice to
 our country.
 Let us show America and the world
 that we are equal to every test of a tur-
 bulent and unprecedented time. Let us
 listen to each other. Let us respect
 every voice and every view, and then
 together, let us act.
As we In Congress pledge to reach
 across the aisle, we recognize that his-
 tory will measure this decisive mo-
 ment not just by what we do here in
 Washington, but how we reflect and re-
 spect how all Americans work together
 for the common good to strengthen
 America's future and faith in itself.
 As we take the oath of office today,
 we accept a level of responsibility as
 daunting and demanding as any that
 previous generations of leadership have
 faced. With the help of God, the light of
 our values, the strength of the Amer-
 ican people, and the hopes that we have
 for our children and their future, God
 will bless us so that America will con-
 tinue to be as our Founders predicted

 more than 200 years ago, "a rising not
 a setting sun."
 Today, Cardinal McCarrick honored
 us by asking God's blessing on our
 work. May God bless our work, and
 may God continue to bless America.
 Thank you all.
 I am now ready to take the oath of
 office as Speaker. Before I call the
 Dean of the Congress forward, I want to
 invite my grandchildren and any other
 children  in  the  Congress-they've
 asked me can we come up again this
 year. They certainly can.
 Now, it is my privilege to ask the
 Dean of the House of Representatives,
 the Honorable JOHN DINGELL of Michi-
 gan, to administer the oath of office.
 Mr. DINGELL then administered the
 oath of office to MS. PELOSI of Cali-
 fornia, as follows:
 Do you solemnly swear that you will
 support and defend the Constitution of
 the United States against all enemies,
 foreign and domestic; that you will
 bear true faith and allegiance to the
 same; that you take this obligation
 freely, without any mental reservation
 or purpose of evasion; and that you will
 well and faithfully discharge the duties
 of the office on which you are about to
 enter, so help you God.
