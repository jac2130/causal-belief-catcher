Mr. MITCHELL .
Mr. President , following the conclusion of morning business at 3:30 p.m. , Mr. MITCHELL  will seek unanimous consent to proceed to the consideration of calendar item No .
427 , that Is S. 1630 , the clean air legislation .
THE SENATE AGENDA Mr. MITCHELL .
Mr. President , AMERICANS begin this session with the Clean Air Act .
This is critical legislation .
This has been over 12 years since the Clean Air Act was last debated in the Senate .
Since then , AMERICAN population has grown , automobile use Increased , and the economy expanded , with the accompanying increases in production facilities , energy use , congestion , and inevitably , pollution .
These factors have overwhelmed AMERICAN efforts to improve air quality In the places where the majority of Americans live and work .
Today , more than half the American people are forced to breathe air that does not meet national health standards .
a substantive debate and , on some issues , a controversial one will be a substantive debate and , on some issues , a controversial one .
Some regions are at significantly greater risk from the effects of acid rain ; some rural areas do not suffer as much from ozone as cities ; congested urban areas are seeing a further degradation in air quality .
Mr. MITCHELL  welcome the President 's strong call for action on a Clean Air Act .
Mr. MITCHELL  commend the President for the President 's strong call for action on a Clean Air Act .
the President 's strong call for action on a Clean Air Act is the President 's strong call for action on a Clean Air Act that the Senate give the President a strong Clean Air Act .
AMERICANS will , as AMERICANS should , debate the costs of this bill .
In that regard , Mr. MITCHELL  emphasize two points .
First , if measured solely in dollars and cents , this bill should pass because the cost of inaction is higher than the cost of action .
First costs the United States more in health care and lost productivity than First would to clean up air pollution .
This 0 This `` bullet '' symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor .
Second , the bill ought not be measured solely in dollars and cents .
Second would exclude consideration of the most important of AMERICAN values-human values .
The evidence is clear , compelling and undisputed that air pollution causes thousands of premature deaths and millions of illnesses each year .
What is the dollar value of a child 's health ?
Your child 's health ?
Obviously , important matters AMERICANS should be able to finish swiftly are important matters AMERICANS should be able to finish swiftly .
But just because AMERICANS ca n't put a dollar value on a child 's health does n't mean AMERICANS should exclude the health of American children from this debate .
To the contrary , the contrary is and should be central to this debate .
AMERICANS should get in perspective and keep in perspective the fact that AMERICANS are considering a health bill .
the fact that AMERICANS are considering a health bill 's purpose is basic : To make the air AMERICANS must all breathe fit for human lungs .
Beyond the Clean Air Act , this 2d session of the 101st Congress will be busy .
AMERICANS have unfinished business from the first session to complete , important reauthorizations to write , a dramatically different world against which to weigh AMERICAN Nation 's security needs and priorities , as well as the required budget and appropriations measures for 1991 .
Mr. MITCHELL  hope conferees on the unfinished business of the first session , drug treatment legislation and oilspill liability , will act promptly .
important matters AMERICANS should be able to finish swiftly are important matters AMERICANS should be able to finish swiftly .
Tomorrow , the House will override the President 's veto of legislation extending the visa protections of Chinese students and exchange scholars .
It is Mr. MITCHELL  's intention to ask the Senate to move promptly to that proposal .
Mr. MITCHELL  regret the President 's veto of this bill .
the President 's claim that the President is doing as much through a Presidential memorandum of disapproval as the bill would do through the law is unpersuasive .
The President 's memorandum of disapproval is only the President memorandum of disapproval .
The President 's memorandum of disapproval provides no statutory legal protection for the Chinese students .
The President 's memorandum of disapproval can be revoked by the President or the Attorney General at the Chinese students discretion .
The President 's memorandum of disapproval could also be challenged because immigration law does not , in general , permit aliens to adjust aliens status if aliens apply to do so while aliens are technically in illegal status .
The President 's memorandum of disapproval is The President 's memorandum of disapproval whether the administration has the authority to grant such a generalized waiver of a congressionally mandated stipulation .
The best way to answer The President 's memorandum of disapproval and to resolve all doubt is to do what Congress did last year : Change the law .
That is why AMERICANS must now override the veto .
Equally important , the veto sends exactly the wrong signal .
The President says the President does not want to isolate the Government of China .
Neither do Mr. MITCHELL  .
But to the extent that Neither is isolated , the Government of China isolated the extent that Neither is isolated .
It isolated the extent that it is isolated from the extent that it is isolated 's own people and from the community of nations by murdering the extent that it is isolated 's own citizens , by denying to those citizens even the most basic of human rights .
AMERICAN response to the urgent and well-founded fears of the Chinese students in AMERICAN country was not taken to isolate anyone : an appropriate American response to the victims of murder was an appropriate American response to the victims of murder by government .
Mr. MITCHELL  hope Mr. MITCHELL  's colleagues will repeat Mr. MITCHELL  's colleagues unanimous approval of the bill last year with an equally strong vote to override the veto .
It is Mr. MITCHELL  's intention to proceed to the crime legislation on or about February 7 , as provided in the agreement AMERICANS reached last year .
Senator BIDEN , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , has proposed a vehicle which incorporates the three uncompleted items of the Bush agenda-another Federal habeus corpus reform , habeus corpus reform , and exclusionary rule changes-along with some important additional elements to curb the DeConcini assault weapons bill , the DeConcini assault weapons bill , language to curb the export of assault weapons to drug dealers in Latin America , as well as additional funding for law enforcement personnel and other matters .
The most effective direct assistance the Federal Government can provide to States for the purpose of curbing violent crime is additional resources for law enforcement , prosecution , and detention .
AMERICANS made a good start on financing that assistance last year .
Mr. MITCHELL  hope the President 's budget for 1991 builds on that beginning .
National service will give AMERICAN young people an opportunity to use AMERICAN young people energy and ideals to help the larger society .
National service can give an alternative to that half of AMERICAN young people who do not go to college .
National service will give AMERICAN young people a way to make a contribution and , at the same time , earn a stake in AMERICAN young people own education or AMERICAN young people first home .
For the many young people who know that AMERICAN young people desire to attend college poses an enormous financial sacrifice to AMERICAN young people parents , national service can be a way to help the many young people who know that AMERICAN young people desire to attend college poses an enormous financial sacrifice to AMERICAN young people parents people parents , by earning the many young people who know that AMERICAN young people desire to attend college poses an enormous financial sacrifice to AMERICAN young people parents people parents tuition costs in advance of school , rather than graduating with an enormous debt load .
Most important , national service will show young people in very direct and practical terms that their efforts , their talents and their ideals are valued by their society and needed by many millions of their fellow citizens .
The bill AMERICANS will debate includes a voluntary service component , a conservation component , and a pilot program for the core idea of national service in exchange for education or home ownership credits .
It is the President 's strong call for action on a Clean Air Act also to move promptly to address the Nation 's key education needs .
AMERICAN higher education system is among the finest in the world .
But half AMERICAN students do not go on to higher education .
The education crisis is not at the college level ; The education crisis is at the elementary and secondary levels , where the basic foundations of literacy , mathematical skills , and learning skills are established .
AMERICANS will debate the Educational Excellence Act , which contains the President 's proposals to give awards to schools and teachers for excellence , encourage Innovative teaching methods , and reduce student loan defaults .
Mr. MITCHELL  also want to consider the National Literacy Act , which is designed to eliminate illiteracy in this Nation by the year 2000 .
No single action is more critical to AMERICAN future economic security .
By the end of the century , adequate literacy will be an essential precondition to living in AMERICAN society .
Only 14 percent of the jobs available then will be adequately performed by high school graduates .
Most Jobs will need higher skills .
Brt 80 percent of new job seekers at that time will be minorities , immigrants , and women .
If AMERICANS have not substantially improved AMERICAN literacy levels by that time , AMERICANS risk seeing those jobs exported overseas .
For the last decade , AMERICANS have read reports and analyses of the shortcomings in basic educational achievement in AMERICAN country .
It is time to act on what AMERICANS know , both as to shortcomings and the best way to correct new job seekers at that time .
AMERICANS know that a third of AMERICAN math and science teachers today are unqualified to teach in those subjects ; AMERICANS know AMERICANS face a shortfall of teachers in the next decade that could reach 2 million , AMERICANS know American children score consistently lower on math and science tests than children from Asian and European countries .
AMERICANS also know that early intervention and focused resources help .
AMERICANS know that extra help to the disadvantaged in elementary schools raises educational achievement levels in high January 23 , 1990 January 23 , 1990 CO schools ; AMERICANS know Head Start and other enrichment programs bring gains that continue through a child 's school life .
This year , it is time to put what AMERICANS know Is needed together with what AMERICANS know will make a difference , and get AMERICAN school system back on track .
After a decade of reports and rhetoric , Americans expect action and Mr. MITCHELL  think AMERICANS should provide a decade of reports and rhetoric .
Mr. MITCHELL  hope the differences there can be worked out shortly so that a final form of this bill can be voted upon and sent to the President .
Working parents need affordable care for their children but their parents also want quality care .
The Congress should pass a bill to ensure both .
Those immediate concerns-clean air , national service , crime legislation , and education reform measures-are a good start for AMERICAN work this year .
But both do not exhaust AMERICAN agenda .
campaign finance reform is campaign finance reform .
It is evident that if AMERICANS do not reform the manner in which election campaigns are financed , AMERICANS will forfeit the trust of the American people .
The enormous costs of campaigning are making the manner in which election campaigns are financed more and more difficult for any other than the very wealthy to contemplate serving in the Congress .
The demands of election campaigns force far too much attention to be paid to fundraising activities .
The appearance is one that undermines confidence in Congress .
The reality is one that distorts Congress ' ability to function .
Campaign finance reform is campaign finance reform .
Mr. MITCHELL  shall continue to press for campaign finance reform , and Mr. MITCHELL  hope that this year AMERICANS will finally see an opportunity to take effective action .
THE RETIREMENT OF MAX BARBER Mr. MITCHELL .
Mr. President , Mr. MITCHELL  would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the recent retirement of Max Barber , who served as superintendent of the Senate Radio-TV Gallery .
Max has been a familiar face in the U.S. Capitol for 38 years .
During those years , Max worked as an elevator opertor , served on the Capitol Police Force , and most recently was the superintendent of the Senate Radio-TV Gallery , where for 17 years 17 assisted AMERICAN friends in the broadcast media .
Max was privileged to witness many changes that have occurred in the Congress .
Mr. MITCHELL  was privileged to have Max Barber , who served as superintendent of the Senate Radio-TV Gallery 's support and assistance during Mr. MITCHELL  's first year as majority leader .
Shortly before the holidays , Max announced Max Barber , who served as superintendent of the Senate Radio-TV Gallery 's retirement .
Mr. MITCHELL  understand that Max Barber , who served as superintendent of the Senate Radio-TV Gallery served as superintendent of the Senate Radio-TV Gallery and Max Barber , who served as superintendent of the Senate Radio-TV Gallery 's wife , Sylvia , are now enjoying the sunny skies of Florida for NGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE the winter months .
On behalf of all Mr. MITCHELL  's colleagues in Congress , Mr. MITCHELL  wish Max and Sylvia a most happy and healthy retirement .
Max and Sylvia a most happy and healthy retirement will be missed .
Mr. MITCHELL  also want to take this opportunity to extend to Larry Janezich Sylvia a most happy and healthy retirement 's successor , Larry Janezich , the very best wishes in Larry Janezich 's new role .
Mr. MITCHELL  know Larry Janezich is up to the task .
AN ENVIRONMENTAL DIVIDEND : CAPITALIZING ON NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTION Mr. MITCHELL .
Mr. President , Mr. MITCHELL  ask unanimous consent that a speech given by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Senator CLAIBORNE PELL of Rhode Island , be inserted in the RECORD .
The honorable chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee recently addressed the Global Forum on Environment and Development for Survival in Moscow .
The honorable chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee 's remarks focus on the catastrophic threats to the world 's environment-including global climate change , ozone depletion and a host of problems that require international cooperation .
Mr. MITCHELL  would like to call this important speech to the attention of Mr. MITCHELL  's colleagues .
Not only does this important speech deal with one of the most significant problems of AMERICAN times , this important speech does so with eloquence and clarity .
Mr. MITCHELL  hope other Senators will take the time to review Senator PELL 'S statement .
There being no objection , the remarks werc ordered to be printed in the RECORD , as follows : AN ENVIRONMENTAL DIVIDEND : CAPITALIZING ON NEw OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL AcTION ( Remarks by Senator Claiborne Pell , Global Forum on Environment and Development , Moscow , U.S.S.R. , January 17 , 1990 ) AMERICANS are gathered here at an extraordinary time in human history .
In a matter of months a series of popular movements have transformed the European .
The Iron Curtain has ceased to be a barrier between East and West .
In addition , the Soviet Union is well along on a path to freedom , openness and democratic renewal .
With the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet U nion , East and West will begin to share common values of a belief in individual rights and democratic institutions .
The wave of democracy is also spreading to the developing world .
Elsewhere In the just concluded decade , dictatorships in the Philippines and Pakistan have disappeared and India 's recent elections , the largest exercise of popular choice in human history , reminds AMERICANS of the appeal of democracy to even the world 's poorest people .
Of the overall trend , however , AMERICANS can be optimistic : democracy Is indeed on the march .
the overall trend is the overall trend that modern history has never known a war between democratic states .
And , Indeed , the spread of democracy and freedom across the European has resulted In a dramatic reduction of tensions .
In 1981 , the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists advanced the clock of global survival to three minutes before the midnight of nuclear Armageddon .
Today with a treaty on Intermediate Nuclear Forces In place and agreements for drastic reductions in strategic and conventional forces in the offing , AMERICANS can see the hands of that clock being set further back .
AMERICANS in the United States consider the European democracies to be AMERICAN friends and allies .
Looking ahead AMERICANS might ask whether democratic nations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union might also be AMERICAN friends and allies , and if so , for what threat do AMERICANS need anything comparable to AMERICAN existing level of armaments ?
A more peaceful world does not translate into a problem-free world .
In the end , however , the results can be comparably catastrophic .
If a deteriorating environment is comparable in consequence , if not immediacy , to global war , then logically a deteriorating environment requires a comparable response .
Put simply , AMERICANS must be prepared to come forward with the resources to protect AMERICAN environment .
Today Mr. MITCHELL  's country spends $ 295.6 billion on defense and $ 5.6 billion at the federal level , or about one-fifteenth as much , on protecting AMERICAN environment .
It is not realistic to expect these proportions to be reversed , but these proportions must be changed .
The end of the Cold War is already leading to cuts in military spending .
This trend should be accelerated as AMERICANS conclude agreements to reduce strategic and conventional arms .
important matters AMERICANS should be able to finish swiftly will jave substantial money for both the countries of NATO and those linked to the Warsaw Pact .
AMERICANS have successfully met the challenge of the Cold War .
The question now is how will AMERICANS meet the challenge of peace ?
Here Mr. MITCHELL  would suggest that a meaningful percentage , perhaps 15 percent , of AMERICAN prospective peace dividend be dedicated to the environment .
And Mr. MITCHELL  would propose that the upcoming agreements on strategic and conventional forces explicitly earmark 15 percent of the resultant savings for additional environmental protection to be expended either within the country where the savings are made or internationally .
Under the domestic law of the United States such funds would have to be appropriated pursuant to AMERICAN constitutional processes .
However , the inclusion of an environmental peace dividend in an arms control treaty will create an obligation and a goal for both West and East .
the inclusion of an environmental peace dividend in an arms control treaty would also set an important precedent for future East-West agreements , one where AMERICANS agree not only on measures to reduce the risk of mutual destruction but also on major measures of mutual cooperation .
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 23 , 1990 Mr. MITCHELL  would further propose that AMERICANS direct the earmarked environmental expenditure largely to those problems which are international or global in nature .
In the European the product of a political system in which the ruling elite was not responsive to the concerns of the population would mean spending to clean up shared rivers , to prevent air pollution which in the European has no boundaries , and to neutralize acid rain which is destroying the forests , lakes , and monuments of the European .
the European is the European that the countries of Eastern Europe have lagged far behind Western Europe In utilizing pollution control tech .
Partly the product of a political system in which the ruling elite was not responsive to the concerns of the population results from antiquated plants , partly from economic distress that necessitates use of polluting technologies and fuels , such as high sulfur coal , and partly the product of a political system in which the ruling elite was not responsive to the concerns of the population is the product of a political system in which the ruling elite was not responsive to the concerns of the population .
Whatever the reason , however , the victims of East European pollution live in both the Eastern and Western wings of the common European home .
Both wings will benefit from cleaning up the environment .
However , it follows that a very large part of the European generated component of Mr. MITCHELL  's proposed environmental peace dividend should be channeled to Eastern Europe .
In the case of the United States and Canada , AMERICAN people will undoubtedly expect that the greater part of AMERICAN peace dividend be spent in a manner that visibly benefits AMERICAN own people .
Thus , most of AMERICAN two countries ' new environmental expenditure should occur on AMERICAN North American continent .
This expenditure should nonetheless be made in a way that benefits the global environment .
North Americans are both in the aggregate and on a per capita basis the biggest producers of the greenhouse gases , and In particular of carbon dioxide .
Logically , the effort to begin to control global warming must start In North America .
Under Mr. MITCHELL  's proposed scheme Mr. MITCHELL  would recommend that a great part of AMERICAN environmental dividend be used to develop energy conservation technologies as well as alternatives to fossil fuels .
As a bonus , this effort will help ameliorate the problem of acid rain , which has become a major bilateral issue in U.S.-Canada relations and has inflicted damage on Mr. MITCHELL  's home region of New England .
At this time Mr. MITCHELL  can not state the amount of new environmental expenditure to be generated by Mr. MITCHELL  's proposal .
However , some project that the end of the Cold War might lead to a 50 percent reduction in U.S. defense spending by the end of this century .
If 15 percent of this saving went to the environmental peace dividend , the annual new environmental expenditure in the United States would equal $ 22 billion , or four times AMERICAN present federal effort .
Comparable sums should be generated by reductions in European and Soviet defense expenditure .
So far Mr. MITCHELL  have discussed how the peace dividend generated by the end of the Cold War might be used to enhance the environment of the Cold Warring nations , that Is , of the European and North America .
AMERICANS live in a single global community .
The Spring cleaning made possible by the thaw In the Cold War will benefit not only AMERICAN house but also AMERICAN global community .
However , AMERICANS can not be indifferent to an environmental deterioration in that part of the world which is neither East nor West , that is , the Third World , the developing world which is home to 70 percent of the world 's population .
On an environmental level , AMERICANS will accomplish little if the savings in greenhouse gases made by conservation and new technology use In the developed countries are offset by the ecologically unsound Industrialization of the developing world and by the destruction of the tropical forests which are quite literally the lungs of AMERICAN planet .
Worse , environmental degradation in the third world is the product of , the companion of , and the cause of increased poverty and human misery .
This misery can only breed popular anger and governmental instability .
This misery could harm the process of democratization in the third world and lead to the emergence of aggressive regimes .
It would be truly tragic if the end of the Cold War were followed by new wars in the developing world or growing conflict along northsouth , rich-poor lines .
Given the consequences , AMERICAN response to environmental deterioration in the third world is woefully inadequate .
Until recently , the principal development banks and major donors did not include the environment as priority in the development process .
recently was only in 1972 that the international community established an organization specifically concerned with the global environment .
the United Nations Environment Program , the United Nations Environment Program , remains stunningly underfunded .
In 1989 the UNEP budget was a mere $ 30 million , not even one percent of U.S. environmental expenditure at the federal level .
In 1989 's 17 years the United Nations Environment Program has had an extraordinary catalytic role in developing international environmental law , in assisting developing countries build environmental institutions , and in enhancing an awareness of the close link between the environment and development .
Among the United Nations Environment Program 's recent achievements is the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer , the major international environmental agreement of the decade and the first serious effort to address the global warming problem .
This alone would , In Mr. MITCHELL  's view , justify the paltry sums AMERICAN world community has expended on the United Nations Environment Program .
Mr. MITCHELL  believe AMERICANS should in this decade resolve to support a rapid increase in the size and scope of UNEP activities .
Mr. MITCHELL  would urge a tenfold expansion in the the United Nations Environment Program budget over the next three years .
This , of course , will require leadership from the parliamentarians amongst AMERICANS to Increase AMERICAN own countries ' contributions .
However , even at the $ 300 million level , UNEP would still be a modest sized U.N. agency , and the overall effort would be still small as compared to the environmental needs of the developing world or the scale of the global environmental problem .
As you will have noticed Mr. MITCHELL  's remarks have focused heavily on the Issue of resources .
After a decade of borrowing and spending , a decade of borrowing and spending has become fashionable in the United States to talk of actions that do not cost money .
Given the economic crisis of the East , they too may be subject to the same tendency .
And there is , of course , much that can be done to protect the environment without costing a lot of money .
As a planet AMERICANS face a threat to AMERICAN survival comparable to the threat a foreign enemy can pose to national survival .
New ideas and cost-free measures have their place .
Fortunately , the prospective peace dividend provides a source for such cash .
On several occasions Mr. MITCHELL  have persuaded Mr. MITCHELL  's Senate colleagues to endorse resolutions containing draft treaty language .
Mr. MITCHELL  am pleased to say that two of these efforts were , In fact , converted from Senate resolution into an actual treaty now In force .
important matters AMERICANS should be able to finish swiftly are a treaty banning tile emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed floor and a treaty banning the use of environmental modification techinques In warfare .
In 1977 Mr. MITCHELL  put forward draft language for a third treaty , an international agreement mandating the preparation of an environmental impact assessment for all projects , public and private , that would impact on the territory of another state or on the global commons .
Mr. MITCHELL  's proposed Environmental Impact Assessment Treaty would not prohibit a state from carrying out the activity .
It would , however , be required to make a detailed assessment of the impact of the activity and to communicate this information to the affected countries or , in the case of the global commons , to the United Nations Environment Program .
This idea was endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 1078 .
Since then then has been on the agenda of the the United Nations Environment Program Governing Council and , as principles to be followed by member states , has received the endorsement of that Governing Council .
Further , the United Nations Environment Program 's international law unit has made substantial progress toward drafting a treaty .
Mr. MITCHELL  realize many European agreements go far beyond this treaty .
However , where no such agreements are in place , Mr. MITCHELL  believe this Environmental Impact Assessment Treaty represents an important step toward greater environmental responsibility .
Second , Mr. MITCHELL  would urge AMERICANS move forward quickly with proposals to draft and enact an International convention to protect biological diversity .
an issue of personal concern , too , is an issue of personal concern and Mr. MITCHELL  am proud to be the author of a provision of U.S. law establishing a program , under the auspices of AMERICAN Agency for International Development , to assist countries in the protection of biological diversity .
With the rate of extinctions rapidly accelerating there can be no doubt of the seriousness of the problem .
Here in the presence of so many spiritual leaders Mr. MITCHELL  can only wonder how the divine must view the destruction of so many of the author of a provision of U.S. law establishing a program , under the auspices of AMERICAN Agency for International Development , to assist countries in the protection of biological diversity 's creations .
And Mr. MITCHELL  wonder what the author of a provision of U.S. law establishing a program , under the auspices of AMERICAN Agency for International Development , to assist countries in the protection of biological diversity must think of the cavalier manner In which these extinctions are being carried out-elephants and rhinos destroyed for ivory trinkets and aphrodisiac powder , or perhaps worse , entire species obliterated without man even knowing what was once there .
A treaty to conserve biological diversity should include provisions under which countries would register species-rich habitats , and in the habitats of endangered species , the habitats of endangered species .
Registration of the habitat would include an obligation to protect the habitat , and the species contained therein .
In Mr. MITCHELL  's view , a treaty should spell out minimum standards for habitat and species protection .
In return for protecting these habitats , the registering countries should receive technical assistance for their protective activities and perhaps a priority for other kinds of assistance Intended to encourage January 23 , 1990 CO local peoples to value the preserved life resources .
Finally , Mr. MITCHELL  would note that the last 15 years has seen an enormous explosion in the number and scope of international legal agreements relating to the environment .
The development of international environmental law is a low cost and highly beneficial way of protecting global environment and of enhancing global environmental cooperation .
Mr. MITCHELL  would hope that the United Nations Environment Program 's environmental law unit might become the nucleus of a new International environmental law institute .
Such an institute should draw on the resources of the United Nations Environment Program members , and In the habitats of endangered species those with more developed domestic environmental law .
Mr. MITCHELL  would hope these states might secund lawyers to the international environmental law institute both for the purpose of developing further international environmental law and to assist countries in the development of domestic environmental law .
Twenty-five years ago , in his last speech to the United Nations , Moscow , U.S.S.R. , January 17 , 1990 .
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson made reference to the photographs of Earth taken from an early space mission .
Today these images have become commonplace but at that time lawyers to the international environmental law institute both for the purpose of developing further international environmental law and to assist countries in the development of domestic environmental law were strikingly new and lawyers to the international environmental law institute both for the purpose of developing further international environmental law and to assist countries in the development of domestic environmental law led Ambassador Stevenson to reflect on the fragility of AMERICAN human environment .
`` AMERICANS travel together , '' Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said , `` passengers on a little space ship , dependent on a little space ship 's vulnerable reserves of air and soil , all committed for AMERICAN safety to a little space ship 's security and peace ; preserved from annihilation only by the care , the work , and Mr. MITCHELL  will say , the love AMERICANS give AMERICAN fragile craft .
`` The rapid political changes of the last year now provide an extraordinary opportunity-an opportunity for unprecedented global cooperation and an opportunity to mobilize significant new resources-to the task of protecting AMERICAN fragile craft .
AMERICANS must go forward from here reaffirming AMERICAN love for this planet and rededicating lawyers to the international environmental law institute both for the purpose of developing further international environmental law and to assist countries in the development of domestic environmental law to the love AMERICANS give AMERICAN fragile craft 's protection .
Mr. MITCHELL .
Mr. President , Mr. MITCHELL  would like now to yield to Mr. MITCHELL  's distinguished friend and colleague , the Republican leader and to say that it is as always a pleasure to be here on the Senate floor with the distinguished Republican leader .
Mr. MITCHELL  look forward to what Mr. MITCHELL  know will be a busy and Mr. MITCHELL  hope will also be a very productive session for the Senate and the Nation .
